Linux::Prctl -- Control process attributes through prctl
========================================================

The linux prctl function allows you to control specific characteristics of a
process' behaviour. Usage of the function is fairly messy though, due to
limitations in C and linux. This module provides a nice non-messy python(ic)
interface.

Besides prctl, this library also wraps libcap for complete capability handling.

Documentation for the perl version of this library needs to be written, but you
can follow the python documentation at http://packages.python.org/python-prctl/
and use the tests as usage examples.

Still missing in version 0.5
- Capability handling
- Securebits handling

INSTALLATION

You can download the latest code from http://github.com/seveas/python-prctl

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   (Some tests need root privileges, run 'sudo make test' if you trust me)
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

Linux kernel 2.6.18 or newer. Some functions are only available in later
kernels, this is documented per function. libcap-dev (Debian) or libcap-devel
(Fedora) is a required package too.
